Welcome! 
----------------

This is my effort to try to restore ExeCoffSky to a partially working state. For those who don't know what this is supposed todo, ExeCoffSky is a compatibility layer allowing windows applications to run on BeOS/Haiku. So far my efforts are in the experimental branch. This Legacy Branch will hold the original non-edited code of ExeCoffSky (of course except for this README).
